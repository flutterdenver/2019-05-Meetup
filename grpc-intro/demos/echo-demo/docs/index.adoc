= Echo Demo: Unary RPC

== Arcitecturual Overview

*echo-demo* is a small project that provides a working example of a
mobile app communicating with a server using gRPC and Protocol Buffers.

The _service definition_ is::
. Located in `grpc-intro/demos/echo-demo/api`
. Written in Protocol Buffers
. Formal documentation of an api:
.. provided by the server
.. consumed by the mobile app
. Used to generate client and server code

The _server_ is::
. Located in `grpc-intro/demos/echo-demo/backend`
. Written in Go
. Built and deployed with Docker

The _mobile app_ is::
. Located in `grpc-intro/demos/echo-demo/app`
. Built with Flutter and deployed as a:
.. native iOS application
.. native Android application

== The Development Process

. Project Initialization
. Defining our service
. Implement our backend
. Generate our app (flutter create)
. Generate client stubs for our service
. Integration testing
. Attach boring user interface

== Code Organization

The *echo-demo* folder contains




== Flutter Project Initialization

[source,bash]
....
$ flutter doctor # <1>
$ flutter create --project-name=echo_demo --org=com.flutterdoctors app # <2>
$ cd app # <3>
$ flutter emulators --launch apple_ios_simulator # <4>
$ flutter run # <5>
....

1. Confirm flutter tools are installed and properly configured
2. Create our Flutter project in the `app` directory (I prefer monorepo, ymmv)
3. Change directories into the newly created `app`
4. Launch an emulator, I chose the iOS Simulator
5. Run your new/default project

== Service Definition

[source,proto,linenums]
....
include::../api/echo_service.proto[]
....
<1> Declare we're using version 3 of the Protocol Buffers language
